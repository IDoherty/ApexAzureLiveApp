Notes on individual pieces of information;

 Output Location Example - Sets Write Pathway for the Packet Dump. Change 'Test Sessions' to reflect the desired file path, and 'Session - ' to reflect the desired session name.
eg. SessionWrite -> Sessions/TestSessions/Session - 

 Read In Session Name Example - Sets the file from which a session is read in. Use the Full Path and name of the desired file.
eg. SessionName -> Sessions/Alumni Stadium - Cork - 17_11_18/Session- 2018-11-17 18-06-47

 Local IP Address Example - Take from the device running the session's Network Profile
eg. LocalAddr -> 192.168.187.131:0
 Beacon Address File Example - Sets the desired NetworkInfo File for the session. File should contain the IP Addresses of each beacon in use, its Number and Name (for reference purposes)
eg. ApexBeaconInfo -> Config/NetworkInfo/NetworkInfoKingspan.txt

Device List Options - allows you to select the desired Apex Device list for filtering output packets.
eg. DevList -> Config/DevList/testDevList.txt
